# Information Security Policy & Best Practices

## Context

As part of the Good Work team, we handle and have access to information and data that originates from our partners, customers and users. It is important for Good Work to ensure best practices are observed to avoid mishandling of data and information that could result in data loss or compromise.  

### Designated work computer

You are required to work on an Apple computer hardware, running the latest macOS version available to your hardware. An exception can be made only upon discussion with your team lead, and with written documentation of the reason behind such an exception. The following protection must be activated on your macOS system: 

- Ensure that a password is always required to log in to your macOS system
- Ensure system screen lock time is set to no shorter than 15 minutes
- Ensure your macOS is always kept up-to-date with the latest security patches via the System menu.
- Ensure that the macOS Firewall is enabled. If the Firewall is temporarily disabled for development purposes (e.g. allowing incoming connections via `ngrok`), you are responsible for ensuring that it is re-enabled once the relevant development task is completed.
