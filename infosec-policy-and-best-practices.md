# Information Security Policy & Best Practices

## Context

As part of the Good Work team, we handle and have access to information and data that originates from our partners, customers and users. It is important for Good Work to ensure best practices are observed to avoid mishandling of data and information that could result in data loss or compromise.  

### Designated work computer

You are required to work on an Apple computer hardware, running the latest macOS version available to your hardware. An exception can be made only upon discussion with your team lead, and with written documentation of the reason behind such an exception. The following protection must be activated on your macOS system: 

- Ensure that a password is always required to log in to your macOS system
- Ensure system screen lock time is set to no shorter than 15 minutes
- Ensure your macOS is always kept up-to-date with the latest security patches via the System menu.
- Ensure that the macOS Firewall is enabled. If the Firewall is temporarily disabled for development purposes (e.g. allowing incoming connections via `ngrok`), you are responsible for ensuring that it is re-enabled once the relevant development task is completed.

## Data storage and transfer

1. You are allowed to store work data only on you *designated work computer*. You are not allowed to make a copy of work data on other computers without prior permission from your team lead.
2. When storing and transferring work data online to coworkers, partners or clients, you are only allowed to upload and facilitate the transfer of such data on the Good Work Workspace Google Drive. This ensures that access to the file is kept secure, backed-up and virus-free.
3. You are *not allowed* to store or transfer data on a physical hard drive or thumb drive, aside from the hard disk of your designated work computer. 



Customer data is not exposed directly to developers.
Database access is only allowed on a need-to-know basis and are revoked after relevant task is completed. 
When handling customer data, including user-generated data and client data, Good Work employees are required to seek confirmation from their team lead on allowed usage if data needs to be transported or inserted into any cloud-hosted database. 
Good Work employees are required to seek permission from their team lead before duplicating or transferring customer data to their local development machine. 


There is no access of STPI's information system available to Good Work. In the event where employee has access to customer's information systems, access is reviewed and revoked when no longer necessary. This review is done at least once a year.

In the event where an employee's work computer is decommissioned, employees are required to consult with their team lead to ensure entire hardware is securely wiped using macOS Erase Assistant utility.
